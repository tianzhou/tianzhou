### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working on [Bytebase](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase), a database DevSecOps tool for the developer, DBA, platform engineering, and security teams, aka the GitLab/GitHub for database.

I'm also curating [star-history.com](https://star-history.com/) in my spare time.
